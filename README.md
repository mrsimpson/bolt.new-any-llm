# OttoDev â€“ playground

This fork of the fork of bolt.new is a playground for evaluatoin of how to better manage the development of ottoDev with a larger, loosely coupled community of developers.
Ideally, the epics, issues and projects from this repository will be transfered to an organization where ottoDev resides.

# Vision

OttoDev is the chat-first IDE in your browser. Based on the awesome ideas from bolt.new, it provides an open, transparent and LLM-provider-agnostic full-stack tool to code aplications.

# What we're working on

To get a transparent idea of what's going on, check the [project board](https://github.com/users/mrsimpson/projects/2) . It provides you with an idea on what the core team members are currently focusing.

Want to know how we schedule development of new features? Check the [roadmap](https://github.com/users/mrsimpson/projects/2/views/4)

Please keep in mind that we don't commit to any timelines! It's just an illustration of the order in which we'd consider it reasonable to work particular areas.

# Contributions

Want to get involved? This is how we organize our backlog:

## Epics

We organize strategic aspects of the development in [epics](https://github.com/mrsimpson/bolt.new-any-llm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aepic).
An epic denotes an area in which multiple features or improvements need to be made.

## Issues

All *features* that are being worked on should be assigned to an epic. They are prioitized by the core team. If you feel comfortable working on them, please have a look at the [architectural map](./docs/docs/architecture-map.md) and the [developer guidelines](./docs/docs/developer-guidelines.md) so that we can easily review and merge your PR!

All *bugs* are identifyable using the the [bug-label](https://github.com/mrsimpson/bolt.new-any-llm/labels/bug). If it's your first contribution, you may check [good first issues](https://github.com/mrsimpson/bolt.new-any-llm/labels/good%20first%20issue)
